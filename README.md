# Intuition
To determine the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of string s so that string t becomes a subsequence of s, we need to find the longest prefix of t that already exists as a subsequence within s. By doing this, we can then determine how many characters from t still need to be appended to s.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers: Start with two pointers, sIndex for iterating through s and tIndex for iterating through t.
2. Iterate through the strings:
Move 'sIndex' from the beginning to the end of 's'.
Whenever 's[sIndex]' matches 't[tIndex]', increment 'tIndex' to check the next character in 't'.
3. Determine the unmatched characters: After the loop, the characters in 't' from 'tIndex' to the end are those that were not found as a subsequence in 's'. The length of this remaining part is the number of characters that need to be appended to 's'.
# Complexity
- Time complexity: The algorithm processes each character of s and t exactly once. Thus, the time complexity is O(n+m) where n is the length of s and m is the length of t.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm only uses a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.







# Code
```
public class Solution {
    public int AppendCharacters(string s, string t) {
                int sIndex = 0;
        int tIndex = 0;

        // Iterate through s and t
        while (sIndex < s.Length && tIndex < t.Length)
        {
            if (s[sIndex] == t[tIndex])
            {
                tIndex++;
            }
            sIndex++;
        }

        // The number of characters to be appended to s
        return t.Length - tIndex;
    }
}
```
